# rigAppDB
Livecode Active Database using Revigniter database libraries

# NON FUNCTIONAL AT THE MOMMENT BUT GETTING CLOSE

## Overview
Not even sure if this will be useful or not but what the heck. This project takes the Revigniter database libraries and brings them to the Livecode App environment.

Revigniter uses an active database model in the Livecode server environment. The libraries work remarkably well. So I had a crazy idea. What would happen if I remove the dependencies of the Revigniter framework and make the Revigniter Database library available for as a Livecode library for use in standalone applications.

rigAppDB does just that. While the functionality is not exactly what is available with Livecode Server, reading the [Database Library and Active Database] (https://revigniter.com/userGuide/database/index.html) documentation on the Revigniter web site is all you need to see what this library can do.

As always, this is an Open Source project and your help is always welcome. Feel free to tackle the project and making Pull Requests and submitting issues.
